Intro to Computational Media

This program was developed as part of my first semester at the Interactive Telecommunications Program at NYU. It is an experimentation with arrays using a fish tank. When the mouse is clicked, a new piece of food will fall from the pointer into the tank. If a fish object crosses the food, it will "eat" it and grow larger. When the fish has eaten too much food, it will split into two new fish and the process repeats.
